Hi,
I have combined MazeWorld solution as a java project, so that it can be easily executed.


1) Import the project into eclipse.
2) As assignment is divide into three categories I have also divided the functionality into three application classes.
	1) Run SingleRobotApp.java for the robot to go from one location to other location(Astar
	2) Run MultiRobotApp.java for multiple robots to move from one location to goal.
	3) Run BlindRobotApp.java for blind-robot assignment



Note: For all the requirements I have included a maze file in the project itself "Maze.txt", we can directly edit in the eclipse
for output please see the report for better understanding.
Start and end nodes are mentioned already in the program.

contact me if you face trouble in executing the project.
